# currency-converter
This project is a responsive currency converter web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert a specified amount of one currency into another using real-time exchange rates. The application has a modern, minimalist user interface with a dark theme, ensuring it is visually appealing and easy to use.
HTML: Structures the web page, including the form, input fields, and result display area.

CSS: Styles the application, providing a clean, modern dark theme with custom properties (:root) for easy color management. It also ensures the layout is responsive.

JavaScript: Handles the core logic, including fetching data from the API, dynamically populating the currency dropdowns, performing the currency conversion calculation, and updating the user interface.
